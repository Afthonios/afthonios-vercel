# üß≠ Next Directus ‚Äì Project Overview

## üéØ Project Goal

Migration of the current Afthonios WordPress-based site into a modern, maintainable and scalable **headless setup** using **Next.js** as frontend and **Directus** as backend. The new structure allows multilingual content, component-based design, responsive layout, and integration with existing LearnDash infrastructure during the transition.

## üóÉÔ∏è Directus Collections

### Singletons
- `classic_header`
- `projectacademy_page`
- planned: `footer`

### Collections
- `micro_courses` ‚Üí individual formations (SCORM)
- `competences` ‚Üí related skill tags

## üõ† Development Notes

- `.env.example` to be documented
- Local dev: `pnpm dev`
- Add ESLint, Prettier configuration
- Normalize `h1‚Äìh3` across all layouts
- Establish consistent color scheme (light/dark mode backgrounds, typography system)
- Localized routes follow `[locale]/(site)/[slug]` pattern using Next.js App Router conventions. The `(site)` folder is used for grouping but not reflected in the URL.
- Language-specific routes (e.g. `/fr/gestion-de-projet` and `/en/project-academy`) map to shared components in `components/pages` to avoid layout duplication.

---


## üß™ Experimental / To-Do

- Replace static message-based translations with Directus-based content
- Build exportable PDF catalogue from micro_courses
- Develop full search and filtering UI for course discovery
- Sync WordPress + Next.js login sessions
- Migrate `/entreprise`, `/mon-compte`, and the main landing page from WordPress
- Integrate SCORM player for standalone delivery

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Immediate Next Steps

- ‚úÖ **Cloudinary Import Script**  
  A working script was created to:
  - Read image assets from structured Cloudinary folders
  - Extract public URLs and metadata
  - Prepare data for import into Directus assets or related collections  
  ‚ûï Completed: Cloudinary re-upload finalized, and export CSV from Directus is ready to be matched and updated by Aysseline. Final update of Directus entries will follow.

- ‚úÖ **Update Micro Courses in Directus with Cloudinary URLs**  
  Cloudinary titles were standardized via re-upload, and Aysseline will now align metadata with the Directus export. Once matched, Directus can be updated using the final CSV.

- üöß **Build Project Academy Page**  
  Focus now shifts to implementing the bilingual landing page for the Project Academy offer:
  - Use existing WordPress content as reference
  - Populate fields from the `projectacademy_page` singleton in Directus
  - Structure layout using Tailwind and component-based Next.js approach
  - Ensure `/fr/projectacademy` and `/en/projectacademy` routes are supported with language toggle

- üñ®Ô∏è **Create Exportable Catalogue**  
  Build a course catalogue that:
  - Can be browsed via a dedicated webpage
  - Can be exported as a lightweight, printable PDF  
  To avoid heavy file sizes due to images, a PDF optimizer may be used.  
  > Alternative: reuse existing standalone GitHub project dedicated to generating the catalogue from CSV or API data.

- üß© **Merge CSV Files: Directus Export + Cloudinary Metadata**  
  Combine the two available datasets:
  - Directus export of `micro_courses` in CSV format
  - Cloudinary image metadata (e.g. URLs, folder names, public IDs)
  
  Goal: enrich the Directus export with Cloudinary URLs (e.g. thumbnail image) based on a shared key (e.g. `slug` or `course_id`) to enable reimport or feed further tools such as the PDF catalogue.

## üèóÔ∏è Page & Component Structure

We have standardized how bilingual pages and UI components are organized:

- **Localized Routes**  
  Pages live under `src/app/[locale]/(site)/[slug]/page.tsx`, e.g.:  
  - `/fr/nouvelle-offre` ‚Üí `src/app/fr/(site)/nouvelle-offre/page.tsx`  
  - `/en/project-academy` ‚Üí `src/app/en/(site)/project-academy/page.tsx`

- **Static Params & Locales**  
  Each page exports a `generateStaticParams()` that reads from the `locales` array (`['fr', 'en']`) to pre-render both language variants.

- **Data Fetching from Directus**  
  - Singletons in Directus (`projectacademy_page`, `page_nouvelleoffre`, etc.) supply all text content fields (e.g. `title_fr`, `title_en`, `intro_text_fr`, `intro_text_en`, etc.).  
  - Fetch functions live in `src/lib/directus.ts` (e.g. `getProjectAcademyPage()`, `getNouvelleOffrePage()`).  
  - Page loaders (`page.tsx`) call these functions and render `notFound()` if the singleton is unpublished.

- **Presentation vs. Data**  
  - **Component Pages**: `src/components/pages/[slug].tsx` contain only presentation logic (graphics, layout, and UI primitives).  
  - **UI Primitives**: Shared building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Sliders, ContactCard, etc.) live in `src/components/ui/` and are reused across pages.

- **Translation Strategy**  
  - All textual content is now fetched from Directus; legacy `next-intl` JSON files are being phased out.  
  - Components simply pick between `data.field_fr` and `data.field_en` based on the `locale` prop.

This structure cleanly separates **content (in Directus)** from **presentation (React components)**, ensuring that designers can update graphics and developers can update layouts without overwriting copy.

## üîç Debugging Directus Fields

When building out new pages or components, it can be helpful to see exactly which fields Directus is returning. We added a temporary debug section in our React components to list all keys and values:

```tsx
{/* DEBUG: list all Directus fields */}
<section className="mt-10 p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Debug: All Data Fields</h3>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside max-h-64 overflow-auto">
    {Object.entries(data).map(([key, value]) => (
      <li key={key} className="break-words">
        <strong>{key}</strong>: {typeof value === 'string' ? value : JSON.stringify(value)}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</section>
```

- **Purpose:** Quickly inspect the full JSON payload from Directus without guessing field names.
- **Usage:** Insert this snippet into any page component after fetching data; remove it once you have mapped all required fields.
- **Result:** Ensures you can wire up exactly the fields defined in your Directus singleton or collection.

This debug method complements using the Directus Admin UI or raw JSON dumps, making component development faster and more reliable.
